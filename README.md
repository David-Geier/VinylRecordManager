# Java Project: [Vinyl Record Repository]

## Overview
> This project is a Spring Boot application integrated with Thymeleaf, built to manage vinyl record collections. It supports full CRUD operations on a database, allowing users to add, update, view, and delete records. The application features dynamic forms with validation for key fields such as title, artist, label, year of release, and size. Records are displayed on a responsive page with sorting functionality and detailed views for each entry, and a dedicated search feature enables quick retrieval of records by unique ID. An H2 database is seamlessly connected to the backend, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of record data.

## Purpose
> I built this project as part of my coursework to learn Java fundamentals. Initially, I implemented a basic solution that worked, but I later elevated it by refactoring the code for improved performance and readability.
